# Credit Card Fraud Detection using ML in Python

This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset used in this project includes a range of transactions, with the objective of identifying which are fraudulent based on various features.

Key Components:

Data Preprocessing:

The dataset is loaded and basic preprocessing steps are applied to handle missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizations and statistical analysis are conducted to understand the distribution of the data, correlations between features, and the balance of the dataset (i.e., the ratio of fraudulent to non-fraudulent transactions).

Model Building:

A machine learning model (likely a classifier such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.) is trained to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent.

The model is trained using a portion of the data and then evaluated on a test set.

Model Evaluation:

The model's performance is assessed using accuracy metrics on both training and test data.
The accuracy on the training data is 95.63%, and on the test data, it is 92.66%, indicating a well-performing model.

Conclusion:

The model is effective at identifying fraudulent transactions, though additional steps like hyperparameter tuning or using more sophisticated models (e.g., neural networks) could potentially improve performance.
